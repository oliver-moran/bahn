A complete HTML5 application stack combining [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (BAHN). Comes pre-rolled a NoSQL databse ([NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) or [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)), HTTP services ([Express](http://expressjs.com/)), and Web Sockets ([Socket.io](http://socket.io/)). Apart from bundling all of these together, the philosophy is otherwise agnostic. Use one, use all, use some.

A seed TODO application that puts the stack through through its paces is included. Have a look in the `/application/` and `/application/static/` directories to start.

To install, download and type:

    npm install
    
To run, type:

    npm start

Config is in the package.json file. Have fun!
